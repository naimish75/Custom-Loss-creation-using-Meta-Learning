## Project Description
This project aims to develop a meta-learning framework that dynamically optimizes loss functions to enhance the performance of computer vision (CV) models. By learning adaptable loss functions, the project seeks to improve model generalization across diverse tasks and datasets. The framework will take a model as input and provide an optimized loss function, exploring few-shot learning algorithms and other meta-learning techniques.


## Proposed Data Sources
The project will utilize a variety of datasets for training and evaluation, including but not limited to:
•⁠  ⁠ImageNet <br>
•⁠  ⁠CIFAR-100 <br>
•⁠  ⁠MNIST <br>
