# Custom-Loss-creation-using-Meta-Learning

## Project Description
This project aims to develop a meta-learning framework that dynamically optimizes loss functions to enhance the performance of computer vision (CV) models. By learning adaptable loss functions, the project seeks to improve model generalization across diverse tasks and datasets. The framework will take a model as input and provide an optimized loss function, exploring few-shot learning algorithms and other meta-learning techniques.

## Proposed Data Sources
The project will utilize a variety of datasets for training and evaluation, including:
- ImageNet
- CIFAR-100
- MNIST

## Project Goals
- Develop a meta-learning framework for dynamic loss function optimization.
- Enhance the performance of computer vision models through adaptable loss functions.
- Improve model generalization across diverse tasks and datasets.
- Explore few-shot learning algorithms and other meta-learning techniques.
- Evaluate the framework on various computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.
